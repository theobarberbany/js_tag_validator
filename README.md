###### Testing

    scan the entire src folder for "x.test.js" files, the __tests__ folder for test files to run.
    Tests are run using nodejs with jsdom.

  *  Tests are formatted using the [expect](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html) statement. 
     Snapshot testing is also supported.
    
  * [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) is used for test rendering.
